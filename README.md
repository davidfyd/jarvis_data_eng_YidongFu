# Yidong Fu . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Yidong Fu and I recently graduated as a Master of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering student at University of Toronto. Ever since I had memories, I have been always interested in the latest technology in the world. That is the reason why I spent tremendous amount of time learning Maths and engineering so that I can adapt to any newest technology quickly. I truly believe that technology is the driving force of human society and I hope I can be part of that.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_YidongFu/tree/master/linux_sql)]: This Linux Cluster Monitor Agent is a tool for monitoring cluster resources such as CPU idle percentage, available disk, and so on. It helps the infrastructure team to monitor cluster resources usage so that they can allocate resources more reasonably.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_YidongFu/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: implements a Java app which can post/show/delete Twitter post via Twitter REST API. Many concepts are implemented such as HTTP Client, Junit Test, Mockito, DAO, and Spring.
  - JDBC App: allows a connection between a Java application and an RDBMS. In addition, DAO and Repository design patterns as well as some advanced JDBC concepts are implemented.
  - Grep App: was developed which will search for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, and output matched lines to a file. Lamdda API and Stream API were introduced in this project to achieve more efficient coding and advanced functional programming.
