summary: My name is Yidong Fu and I recently graduated as a Master of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering student at University of Toronto. Ever since I had memories, I have been always interested in the latest technology in the world. That is the reason why I spent tremendous amount of time learning Maths and engineering so that I can adapt to any newest technology quickly. I truly believe that technology is the driving force of human society and I hope I can be part of that.
